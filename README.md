Spam Message Detection
This project builds a machine learning model that detects spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms. The goal is to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) with high accuracy.

🧠 Problem Statement
The task is to create an intelligent system that can automatically classify incoming messages as spam or not spam based on the text content, using historical labeled data.

📚 Dataset
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as 'ham' (non-spam) or 'spam'.

Text data is preprocessed and vectorized for model training.

⚙️ Features
🔡 Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming)

🔢 Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer

🤖 Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes

📊 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

🧪 Test input message prediction

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning and evaluation)

NLTK (for natural language processing)

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Model Evaluation
The spam classifier is evaluated using:

✅ Accuracy Score

📉 Confusion Matrix

🧮 Precision, Recall, F1-score
